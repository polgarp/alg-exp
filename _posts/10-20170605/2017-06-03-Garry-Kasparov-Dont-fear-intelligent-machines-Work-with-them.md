This is a nie talk by chess-champion Garry Kasparov who was beaten by IBM's Deep Blue in 1997. He presented some ideas, on how computers and humans could work together, but there was one I liked the most. Better interaction is stronger than a great human and a great computer combined with a weak interaction. Something worth designing for.
