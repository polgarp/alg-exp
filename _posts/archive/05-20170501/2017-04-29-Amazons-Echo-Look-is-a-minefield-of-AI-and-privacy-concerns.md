Having somebody tell you if you look sharp or not is an interesting application, even if this somebody is a shop clerk who just wants to sell you more clothes in the end and is not that concerned with you personally. Since this tech is capable to find out so much more about you - that maybe even you don't know about yourself, trust as a product / brand feature will be even more important in the future. You wouldn't trust just anybody to look around in your closet.
