Nice find on this article over 30 years ago, and it feels more relevant then ever. If we automatize all the easy things in a workflow, we leave only the hard things for the human operator. If we apply machine learning to all the things that we can easily collect data for, so humans can go for decisions on the strategic level, rather on the tactical level - we keep the humans from learning the tactics. Doesn't sound like successful design on the long-term.
