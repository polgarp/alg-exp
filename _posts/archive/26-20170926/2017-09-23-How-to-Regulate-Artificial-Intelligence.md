Interesting proposal, especially comparing to Asimov's laws. The thing is with the laws of robotics as Asimov described would be defined in the robots' brains by default, there was no way to create a robot without the laws. I wonder how policy can be defined to have a such strong control over an AI. In any case these rules make sense and would drive AI developments into a more ethical direction.
