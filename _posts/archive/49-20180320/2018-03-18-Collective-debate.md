Very interesting experiment, where you debate with an AI powered agent that provides counterpoint to your views. AI tech in the wild on social networks is often used to create filter bubbles, so it's interesting to see a counterpoint to that. Besides the content the interaction is also well designed, kind a like in a video game.
