Nice interview with Matt Turck of FirstMark Capital. Overall AI startups are very similar to other startups, only data and tech is not as easy yet as with other services. More like hardware based companies, as prototyping and getting things right takes exceptional talent and longer time. Matt didn't mention design as an issue, most probably since these startups need the technology right first before they can invest more on their actual apps. But is it wise to invest into tech if you don't understand your customers well enough? Leads to even more time prototyping.
