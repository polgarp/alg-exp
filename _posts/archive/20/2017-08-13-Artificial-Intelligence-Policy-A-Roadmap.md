Very through and interesting paper on the questions of policy making in relation to AI technologies. Even if AI related laws will be more affected by political discussions (like I expect a "Frankenstein Act" to happen as soon as a more complicated system does something dangerous to happen), many decisions will be based on research like this, so it's well worth to understand what are some of the shaping ideas. Constraints set by laws will also affect the type of systems we will be able to design.
