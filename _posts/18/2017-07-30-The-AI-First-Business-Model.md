There seems to be a lot of talk about "AI-first business", though much less info on how exactly this works. This article offers some points on this, in particular how such companies should function. Unfortunately this model misses the design function, though in most companies it's probably rolled into the product organization. This setup would lower the value of people-facing AI products, as the design knowledge would be missing from the C-Level.
