If strict regulation would happen (armed Federal AI Bureau officers cracking down on rouge researchers), not sure if it would amount to anything. AI research has an even lower cost than other discipline with a high potential for destruction (like biotech for example). Especially with the examples mentioned, like propaganda. So we need to design systems with thinking about malicious entities who would use the advances against us. Asimov's laws of robotics feels more and more attractive.
