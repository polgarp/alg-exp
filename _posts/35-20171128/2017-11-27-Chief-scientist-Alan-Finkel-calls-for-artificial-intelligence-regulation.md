Asimov stamp for ethical or more generally a kind of certification for algorithmic products / services comes up many times. I guess mostly since similar things stamps worked earlier. The thing is - some of the bias can be decreased with the right approach, but what most people perceive as "bad AI" mostly comes from two things. One is malevolent actors, not sure a stamp would help on this. Second is that these type of algorithms however they are designed build on data and just amplify existing bias. Like a mirror, we are looking at ourselves.
