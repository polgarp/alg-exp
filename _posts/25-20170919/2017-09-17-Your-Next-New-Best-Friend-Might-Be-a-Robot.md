Interesting read on a celebrity chatbot. There many nice details, like what design principles make the bot better conversation partner, and how they measure their success. One fear would be with an all-powerful, better than your human friends chat partner would be that we end up talking with each other even less. So I wonder, how such a technology could be used to have people talk more to each other.
