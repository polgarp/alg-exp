Great analysis on Google's Assistant product (plenty of new features of it were just announced at Google I/O). While UX seems indeed to be a driving force here, I'm not so sure if it can be compared to previous UI paradigm shifts. Also while UX is indeed a huge challenge, product questions are as many (Google has to work across a huge portfolio of products, and probably also integrate with third parties), to best UX won't work without a great product and vice-versa.
