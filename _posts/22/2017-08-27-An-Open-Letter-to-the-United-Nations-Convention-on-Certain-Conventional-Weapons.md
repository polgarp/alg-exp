Short but important letter, on the topic of "let's not build robots with guns". Quite an impressive list of signatures. Terminator robots do sound scary, but hackable weapon systems even more so, especially if we look at the current state of IOT security. This is a cause even designers should push, let's not design systems that can be used for weapons, and even lets not design systems that can be used to create weaponised AI tech.
