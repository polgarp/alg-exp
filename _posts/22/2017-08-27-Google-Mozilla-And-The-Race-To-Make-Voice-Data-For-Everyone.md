Pretty awesome that Mozilla now leading the way not just in free software, but also in free (and maybe open source) data. Software and algorithms are less and less interesting as a property, this is one of the reasons why Google and others release their internal tools. Software generally is also getting cheaper. But data is different, collecting a huge amount of data takes lots effort and resources and quality data (with low bias) even more so. This is why Mozilla's efforst are so exiting, such open data (because how it's crowdsourced) has a better chance of being low bias.
