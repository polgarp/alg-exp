I like all three of these problems, as they relate pretty well to non AI related product problems: make the system's state clear, choose your user problem to focus on before technology, and involve designers within product teams from day one. The last one feels the most challenging to actually pull through, as design in most companies has still a shallow impact - only user related functions. But everybody needs to understand, whenever there is a decision that impacts the user in any way (like database speed), there needs to be somebody who explicitly champions the user needs. Designers seem to be well suited for this, but their understanding of their role needs to change too.
