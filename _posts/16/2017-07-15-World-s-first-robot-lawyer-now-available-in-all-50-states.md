This looks like a very useful service. "Lawyerspeak" can differ from plain, everyday language by a lot, since it's very precise and specific. This specificity also makes it ripe for automation, and lawyer firms are also doing it via templates especially in trivial cases. But what is even more awesome that this automation helps a wider range of people not able to afford professional help.
