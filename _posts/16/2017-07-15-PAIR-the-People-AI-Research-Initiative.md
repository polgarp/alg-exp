A new program by Google, "focusing on the human side of AI", so essentially researching how interaction happens between people and AI tech. This sounds more like an academic program (I expect nice papers on next year's CHI), but they seem to take a route that will be also useful for a wider range of practitioners, promising to release guidelines and open source tools. Probably something worth keeping an eye on.
