Pretty amazing app from Microsoft, it "narrates the world around you. Designed for the low vision community, this research project harnesses the power of AI to describe people, text and objects." Just as with other types of personal assistants, AI tech may take over helping people with disabilities. Great way to enhance people's skills.
