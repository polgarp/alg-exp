Interesting longread on IBM's Watson initiative. If I'd have to guess focusing marketing only on artificial intelligence (however companies call it) gets old really fast. As tech gets more mainstream companies and investors are less and less interested in it and mainstream has and maybe will have a hard time understanding it. It's only a technology after all. So question is how fast can IBM turn it's capabilities into truly astonishing products that could actually capture the attention of a wider audience.
