An older TED talk by Eli Pariser about the filter bubbles personalization and algorithmic editing is creating. I loved his comparison on dietary needs, just like with food, you have to take care what you consume, you cannot go always for chocolate cake, you need to eat also vegetables - looking out of your filter bubble. Good idea for designers to think about food labels applied to online content, fighting fake news anyone?
