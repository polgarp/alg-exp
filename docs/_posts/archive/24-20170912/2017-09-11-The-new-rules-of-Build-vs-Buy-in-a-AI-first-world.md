I don't see build or buy such a clear cut question. Ofcourse if a company doesn't have any technological capabilities to speak of they are better of buying a service. But in almost all the cases, the buying of AI technologies is risky because of bias. It's not just data that introduces bias into AI, also the specific selection of all the parts and if a company doesn't own its own stack, they risk unknown biases entering their systems. Such biases doesn't exist with non-AI tech.
