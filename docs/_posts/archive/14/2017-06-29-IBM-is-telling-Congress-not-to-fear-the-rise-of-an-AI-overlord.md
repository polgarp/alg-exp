I wonder what story IBM's people tell about what kind of changes are to be expected. Both trying to stop organizations expand their AI tech's use, or trying to fit AI tech into current policy constraints seems to be a mistake, it can have a much more profound effect on people and society as a whole. Lawmakers shouldn't be ignorant even on the details of this tech.
