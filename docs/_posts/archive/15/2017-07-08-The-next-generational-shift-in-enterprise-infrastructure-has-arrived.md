Interesting analysis on how enterprise software might incorporate AI tech - essentially into a new layer between data and functions called referred to as System of Intelligence. Conceptually this seems the right place - not a piece of UI labelled as AI, but more like a backend kindof that works together with the human facing layers. The analysis provides a few nice examples too, for example how these kind of systems might change security processes. I'm not so sure about the name (SoI), maybe this one will be also corporate bullshit very soon.
